# Animated-webpage
This is an animated webpage which is made using HTML, CSS, GSAP &amp; Swiper JS

It's a non-responsive webpage. I'll be making it responsive soon...
So, if you're using a PC then you'll see the actual contents of the page by clicking â†’ https://ashevan98.github.io/Animated-webpage/

(It's just a front-end work, no back-end & databases are added to the project)
